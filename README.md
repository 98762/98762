- 👋 Hi, I’m @98762 README.md
- 👀 I have been well and truly skooled for neglecting this ommunity's ethos. I may have got off lightly 
- 🌱 due to my willingness to take my medicine very slowly but not the best way to put the good foot forward.
- 💞️ I’m looking find someone who can help a hacking technique which is ... tiresome. I have it printed out like a
school project, but anyone who can help establish a counter against would be the cat's pyjamas.
Was always curious about the G'Hub but in a rush for a manual I found scorn (rightfully) but also what this plac
is about. shame  i came on so late as I might have done more of the right thing at more of the right time.
Still, I kinda earned being led by the nose... 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
